<i>Our guest shared his own true story of being kidnapped</i>

Tonight, DARK Matters fills the Pack Theater with the true story of a kidnapping, a possible hoax out of Northern California that keeps getting weirder, and an in-depth analysis (and a new theory) about the disapperance and murder of Elissa Lam at the Cecil Hotel.

Want to find out how to avoid getting abducted? Come tonight and see if you can spot the common thread tying all of these disappearances together. The choice, as always is yours. Our call-in line is (818) 650-DARK. We're looking forward to hearing from you.
