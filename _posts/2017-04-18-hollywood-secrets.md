Power. Fame. Money. High Society. SECRETS. This month, DARK Matters returns with an incredibly special show. Our guests will include Hollywood writers and directors who will remain anonymous through the show, as well as longtime film actor Dennis Woodruff, who will be staging his screenplay "The Claw" at the show. As always, the show will feature music by Rich Devletian, and your calls.

Do you have a Tinseltown experience you'd like to share? Our phone number is (818) 650-DARK. Call us. We're listening.
