We'll be auctioning off this one-of-a-kind DARK Matters pillow and much more tonight! Mall Santas, professors from UCLA, and a holiday greeting from Sam Elliot await tonight at the Pack Theater!

Feeling generous? Like what you hear? Curious about removing the world behind the curtain? Call us at (213) 438-9845, and you might be featured on one of our upcoming mini-sodes. Or come see the real deal on Thursday December 1, where we will be discussing commercialization of the holidays. Check out the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/227111141054262/) for more details.
