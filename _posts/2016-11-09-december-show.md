DARK MATTERS will be back December 1, smack dab in the middle of the holiday season, to dissect and skewer the American holiday tradition of unbridled spending. Our guests will include a former mall Santa, a professor of marketing, and we will be auctioning Dark Matters-branded apparel, gifts, and experiences.
