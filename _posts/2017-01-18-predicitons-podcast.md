<i>Nosferatu joined Nostradamus for our 2017 Predictions</i>

Our 2017 predictions stretched from politics to economics to the impending Armegeddon (which is only a few weeks late as of now!). The podcast is available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-is-dark-matters/id1174542551?mt=2">iTunes</a> and at <a href="http://darkmatters.libsyn.com/podcast/2016">Libsyn</a>. Download, subscribe, learn, laugh, and hear what Deb Jones has been up to.

Feeling generous? Like what you hear? Curious about removing the world behind the curtain? Call us at (818) 650-DARK, and you might be featured on one of our upcoming mini-sodes. Or come see the real deal January 28, 2017, where we'll have a psychic to find out if Michael Bilow can find love with one of three blind dates!
