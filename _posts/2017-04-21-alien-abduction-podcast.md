DARK Matters is back and blowing the lid off of the true purpose of music, and what it's like to accidentally become a celebrity in the UFO community. Our guests, composer Scott Smalley and Justin Gaar, director of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80156915">Curse of the Man who Sees UFOs</a> discuss this and more on this month's podcast, available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-is-dark-matters/id1174542551">iTunes</a> and at <a href="http://darkmatters.libsyn.com/podcast">Libsyn</a>. Download, subscribe, learn, laugh, and maybe Scott will hear a little noise coming from your direction.

Like what you hear? Curious about removing the world behind the curtain? Call us at (818) 650-DARK, and you might be featured on one of our upcoming mini-sodes. Join us on April 22, when we'll be splitting the seedy underbelly of La La Land open in a show we call: HOLLYWOOD SECRETS.
