Dark Matters is back next Thursday for its sophomore show on ghosts!

Franky and Michael spent time with some new friends at Amendella Paranormal, hunting for ghosts in the [Pack Theater](http://www.packtheater.com), and you won't believe what they've found.

Joining the show this month is Associate Producer Katie Reed, who will be handling the phone lines and helping with the recording. Katie works as a video editor at Smosh and performs regularly all over Los Angeles.

The show starts at 11:59 pm this Thursday, September 1, and phone lines will open for the first time around 12:10, and close for the night just after 1 am. If you have a paranormal experience with a ghost, or a question for our ghost hunters, please call us at 213-438-9845. We will be announcing when lines are open or closed on [social media](http://www.twitter.com/darkmattersshow).
