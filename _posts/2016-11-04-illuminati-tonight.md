DARK MATTERS is tonight a the Pack Theater. Learn about the Illuminati, the lizardmen, and the Freemasons as we interview a member of the Illuminati live on-stage. Find out if some of the great strings of power were pulled to get the Cubs to win the world series. The phones will be open starting at 12:10 am, call in at 213-438-9845.

More information, and a chance to connect with your fellow truth-seekers at the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/580647692127043/).
