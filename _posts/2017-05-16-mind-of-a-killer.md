What drives one human being to end another's life? Is it preventable? Is it innate? Can it be stopped or controlled? This month, DARK Matters returns to answer these questions and many more as we explore the inner workings of the mind of a killer. Our guests will include a forensic psychologist, who will administer a test for psychopathic tendencies to one of our hosts. Can you guess which one?

Want to confess something? Our phone number is (818) 650-DARK. Call us. We're listening.
