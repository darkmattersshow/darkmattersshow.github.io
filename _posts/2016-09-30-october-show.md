title: October 6 Show -- CULTS 
---

After successfully plumbing the depths of the mysteries surrounding ghosts, Dark Matters returns to the [Pack Theater](http://www.packtheater.com) for its third installment on cults. 

Our guests include Cathy Schenkelberg, who spent 14 years as a Scientologist, and will tell us about her years in the church.  As always, our amazing one-man house band, Rich Develtian will be providing the score for the night as we explore the dark side of religion.

The show starts at 11:59 pm this Thursday, October 6. This show will be standing-room only, so get there early! And if you've been in a cult, or have experience with a cult, please call us at 213-845-9845. Phone lines open at 12:10 am, and we will be announcing when lines are open or closed on [social media](http://www.twitter.com/darkmattersshow).
