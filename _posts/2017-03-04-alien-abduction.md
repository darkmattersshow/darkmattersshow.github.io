Since ancient times, human beings have identified existences other than our own in the universe; there are claims that alien life forms assisted in the construction of great human monuments like the Pyramids and Stonehenge, while others claim that life itself was brought to Earth from across the stars. March 25, DARK Matters probes ALIEN ABDUCTION. Our guests will include UFO researchers and abductees. Keep it tuned right here for more details.

Do you have an alien encounter you'd like to share? Our phone number is (818) 650-DARK. Call us. We're listening.
