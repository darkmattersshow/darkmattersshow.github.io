date: "2017-01-11"

After smashing success, sellout crowds, and iTunes download numbers that make Tim Cook sweat through his Egyptian cotton sheets, DARK MATTERS will be moving to a new time and day, 11pm on the 4th Saturday of the month. 

We're blowing out the first show of our cherry night and time by exploring the world of love _andx_ the world of psychics. We bring you: PSYCHIC DATING.

Host Michael Bilow will go on dates with three women. He will get to know them, they will get to know him, and a psychic will get to know them both, psychically.

With our new night and new time comes a new phone number: 818-650-DARK. Call us.We're listening.
