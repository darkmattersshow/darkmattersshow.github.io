Fans of <a href="http://www.feralaudio.com/show/my-favorite-murder/">My Favorite Murder</a>, get happy; host of the podcast Karen Kilgariff will be joining DARK Matters as a guest on our MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES show. Join us Saturday, Feburary 25 at the Pack Theater to find out about the Sherri Papini case--the disappearance that keeps getting weirder.
