Dark Matters is starting off with a bang, straight into the past (and the future?). Our guests for our first show at the [Pack Theater](http://www.packtheater.com) include Caltech physicist Evgeny Mozgunov, actor Sam Elliot, and a special call-in from a man who refers to himself only as "Mister Time." 

Rich Devletian joins Franky and Michael as Music Director for Dark Matters--check out his band [UpDownUp](https://www.facebook.com/updownup).

The show starts at 11:59 pm this Thursday, August 4. Phone lines open at 12:10 am, and we will be announcing when lines are open or closed on [social media](http://www.twitter.com/darkmattersshow).
