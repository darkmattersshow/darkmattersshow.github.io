This month's show on comercialization of the holidays is right around the corner! Everyone who comes to the show receives a DARK Matters guitar pick (with $8 donation to the Pack Theater), and we'll have more amazing DARK Matters branded merch for you to bid on! Proceeds benefit the [Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition](http://www.gwhfc.org) and the [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://www.splcenter.org).
