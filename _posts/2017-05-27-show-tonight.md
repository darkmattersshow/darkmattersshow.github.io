<i>What's <b>really</b> inside host Michael's mind?</i>

Tonight, DARK Matters soaks the Pack Theater with the gory psyche of the mind of a killer. Our guests include killers, and a forensic psychologist, who will be administering a test for psychopathic tendencies on one of our hosts.

Come tonight and find out how to spot a killer in your neighborhood. The choice, as always is yours. Our call-in line is (818) 650-DARK. We're looking forward to hearing from you.
