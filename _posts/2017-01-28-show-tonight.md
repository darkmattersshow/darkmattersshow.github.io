TONIGHT! Our brave hosts (including our one lovelorn host) return to the Pack Theater for a night of supernatural romance. Our guest will be a tarot and energy reader, who will determine the results of three blind dates our host had. The results of the three dates (and a fourth, mystery date?) will be revealed in front of an audience including our lovelorn host's parents.

Like what you hear? Curious about removing the world behind the curtain? Call us at (818) 650-DARK, and you might be featured on one of our upcoming mini-sodes. Or come see the real deal tonight.
