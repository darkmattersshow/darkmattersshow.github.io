Taking its inspiration from Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM, Dark Matters explores the world of the scientific, the metaphysical, the strange, and the occult with a scientist's curiosity and a journalist's ear for the truth.

Dark Matters was created by Franky Guttman & Michael Bilow. Katie Reed is the Associate Producer, and Rich Develetian is our Music Director.
